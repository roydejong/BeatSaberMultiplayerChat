### Download

[**👉 Download the latest release here**](https://github.com/roydejong/BeatSaberMultiplayerChat/releases/latest)

## Features

The chat features work on all servers, but only with other players that have the mod installed as well. Have fun, and
remember: be nice. 😊

### Text chat

Press the <kbd>💬</kbd> button in the lobby to open the chat box where you can see and type messages.

#### Chat bubbles

Whenever someone sends a text message in the lobby, a chat bubble will appear over their heads. You'll also see a
smaller notification above the menu in the center.

#### Notification sounds

A notification sound is played whenever someone sends a chat message.

You can change or disable the notification sound via the Mod Settings. You can add your own sounds by placing `.ogg`
files in `Beat Saber\UserData\MultiplayerChat`.

### Voice chat

Players who have this mod installed can talk in multiplayer lobbies and hear others!

You can talk in the lobby and while playing, but you can currently only hear avatars that you can actually see. *(You
can't hear spectators, and you can't talk during loading screens.)*

⚙️ Set up and test your microphone and keybind from the **settings button in the main menu**. I recommend reviewing your
settings there before heading into a lobby.

### Muting players

You can press the <kbd>🔇</kbd> mute button next someone in the players list. If a player is muted, you won't see their
chat messages or hear their voice anymore.

Muted players are saved in the configuration file, so they'll stay muted across different lobbies.

### Mod Settings

Press the <kbd>Multiplayer Chat</kbd> button in the main menu to open the settings screen. You can set and test your
voice chat and text chat settings here.

- **Voice chat**
    - Enable/disable voice chat
    - Select and test your recording device for voice
    - Select and test your voice keybind
- **Text chat**
    - Enable/disable
    - Change your notification sound
    - Toggle chat bubbles

## Notice

⚠️ **Text and voice chat communications using this mod are not encrypted.**

Communication packets are not end-to-end encrypted, which means the server can always read them.

While your connection to the server itself is encrypted, a modded client will not verify server certificates which makes
it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

You should not rely on this mod for secure communications.

## For modders

### For mod developers

If you use Zenject, you can depend on this mod and request the `ChatManager` instance (installed in the App container)
to send and receive text messages.

### For server developers

You can send text chat messages using the `MpcTextChatPacket`. If the message originates from the connection owner, the
mod will display it as coming from the server with some special formatting.

Sending or broadcasting text messages could be useful for custom game modes, providing players with instructions,
debugging, etc.

### Packet structure

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Documented protocol version: **2**

#### Base packet (`MpChatBasePacket`)

Each chat packet inherits from `MpChatBasePacket`.

| Field             | Type      | Comment                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ProtocolVersion` | `VarUInt` | Protocol version. Currently always set to **2**. Will be incremented if chat features change in a breaking way. See `MpChatVersionInfo` class. |

#### Capabilities packet (`MpChatCapabilitiesPacket`)

Reliable packet sent to each player indicating that they have the mod installed, and specifically which features they
have enabled. Could be sent as an update when already connected.

| Field                  | Type   | Comment                                                                                          |
|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CanTextChat`          | `Bool` | Indicates whether text chat is supported and enabled.                                            |
| `CanReceiveVoiceChat`  | `Bool` | Indicates whether voice chat is supported and enabled.                                           |
| `CanTransmitVoiceChat` | `Bool` | Indicates whether voice chat is supported and enabled, and a valid recording device is selected. |

#### Text message packet  (`MpChatTextPacket`)

Reliable packet containing a simple text chat message.

| Field  | Type     | Comment                                                                                                                             |
|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Text` | `String` | Raw chat message. Note: any HTML-style `<tags>` will be stripped from the message before it is displayed, to avoid rich text chaos. |

Text messages that start with `/` are reserved for commands. They will only be sent to the server, and not seen by other
players in the session.

#### Voice fragment packet  (`MpChatVoicePacket`)

Unreliable packet containing a Opus-encoded voice fragment.

| Field   | Type              | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Index` | `VarUInt`         | Rolling sequence number of the audio fragment (modulo 256).                                                                                                                            |
| `Data`  | `BytesWithLength` | Opus-encoded audio fragment (48kHz, 1 channel). Each fragment represents a frame with 960 samples (20ms). If the array has a length of zero, this indicates the end of a transmission. |
